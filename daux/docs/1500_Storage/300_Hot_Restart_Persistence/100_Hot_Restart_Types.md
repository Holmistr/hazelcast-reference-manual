The Hot Restart feature is supported for the following restart types:

- **Restart after a planned shutdown**:
	- The cluster is shut down completely and restarted with the exact same previous setup and data.

		You can shut down the cluster completely using the method `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()` or you can manually change the cluster state to `PASSIVE` and then shut down each member one by one. When you send the command to shut the cluster down, i.e. `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()`, the members that are not in the `PASSIVE` state temporarily change their states to `PASSIVE`. Then, each member shuts itself down by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`.

		Difference between explicitly changing state to `PASSIVE` before shutdown and shutting down cluster directly via `HazelcastInstance.getCluster().shutdown()` is, on latter case when cluster is restarted, cluster state will be in the latest state before shutdown. That means if cluster is `ACTIVE` before shutdown, cluster state will automatically become `ACTIVE` after restart is completed.

	- Rolling restart: The cluster is restarted intentionally member by member. For example, this could be done to install an operating system patch or new hardware.

		To be able to shut down the cluster member by member as part of a planned restart, each member in the cluster should be in the `FROZEN` or `PASSIVE` state. After the cluster state is changed to `FROZEN` or `PASSIVE`, you can manually shut down each member by calling the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()`. When that member is restarted, it will rejoin the running cluster. After all members are restarted, the cluster state can be changed back to `ACTIVE`.

- **Restart after a cluster crash**: The cluster is restarted after all its members crashed at the same time due to a power outage, networking interruptions, etc.
