![image](../images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *You cannot use SSL when [Hazelcast Encryption](03_Encryption.md) is enabled.*

One of the offers of Hazelcast is the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol which you can use to establish an encrypted communication across your cluster. Note that, if you are developing applications using Java 8, you will be using its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security).

### SSL for Hazelcast Members

Hazelcast allows you to encrypt socket level communication between Hazelcast members and between Hazelcast clients and members, for end to end encryption. To use it, you need to implement `com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.SSLContextFactory` and configure the SSL section in network configuration.

```java
public class MySSLContextFactory implements SSLContextFactory {
  public void init( Properties properties ) throws Exception {
  }

  public SSLContext getSSLContext() {
    ...
    SSLContext sslCtx = SSLContext.getInstance( protocol );
    return sslCtx;
  }
}
```

```xml
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <network>
    ...
    <ssl enabled="true">
      <factory-class-name>
          com.hazelcast.examples.MySSLContextFactory
      </factory-class-name>
      <properties>
        <property name="foo">bar</property>
      </properties>
    </ssl>
  </network>
  ...
</hazelcast>
```

Hazelcast provides a default SSLContextFactory, `com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory`, which uses configured keystore to initialize `SSLContext`. You define `keyStore` and `keyStorePassword`, and you can set `keyManagerAlgorithm` (default `SunX509`), `trustManagerAlgorithm` (default `SunX509`) and `protocol` (default `TLS`).

```xml
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <network>
    ...
    <ssl enabled="true">
      <factory-class-name>
          com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory
      </factory-class-name>
      <properties>
        <property name="keyStore">keyStore</property>
        <property name="keyStorePassword">keyStorePassword</property>
        <property name="keyManagerAlgorithm">SunX509</property>
        <property name="trustManagerAlgorithm">SunX509</property>
        <property name="protocol">TLS</property>
      </properties>
    </ssl>
  </network>
  ...
</hazelcast>
```

You can set `keyStore` and `keyStorePassword` also using the following system properties.

 - `javax.net.ssl.keyStore`
 - `javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword` 

### SSL for Hazelcast Clients

Hazelcast Java and .NET clients also have SSL support. Following is a programmatic configuration for Java client:

```java
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore", new File("hazelcast.ks").getAbsolutePath());
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", new File("hazelcast.ts").getAbsolutePath());
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword", "password");

ClientConfig clientConfig = new ClientConfig();
clientConfig.getNetworkConfig().addAddress("127.0.0.1");
```

### SSL Performance Improvements for Java

SSL can have a significant impact on performance. There are a few ways to increase the performance. 

The first thing that can be done is making sure that AES intrensics are used. Modern CPUs (2010 or newer Westmere) have hardware support for AES encryption/decryption and if a Java 8 or newer JVM is
used, the JIT will automatically make use of these AES instructions. They can also be explicitly enabled using `-XX:+UseAES -XX:+UseAESIntrinsics`, 
or disabled using `-XX:-UseAES -XX:-UseAESIntrinsics`. 

A lot of encryption algorithms make use of padding because they encrypt/decrypt in fixed sized blocks. If not enough data is available in a block, the algorithm relies on random number generation to pad. Under Linux, the JVM automatically makes use of `/dev/random` for 
the generation of random numbers. `/dev/random` relies on entropy to be able to generate random numbers. However if this entropy is 
insufficient to keep up with the rate requiring random numbers, it can slow down the encryption/decryption. This can be easily fixed
by adding the following system property `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom`. For a more permanent solution, modify 
`<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security/java.security` file, look for the `securerandom.source=/dev/urandom` and change it 
to `securerandom.source=file:/dev/./urandom`.

Another way to increase performance for the Java smart client is to make use of Hazelcast 3.8. In Hazelcast 3.8, the Java smart client 
automatically makes use of extra I/O threads for encryption/decryption and this have a significant impact on the performance. This can
be changed using the `hazelcast.client.io.input.thread.count` and `hazelcast.client.io.input.thread.count` client system properties.
By default it is 1 input thread and 1 output thread. If SSL is enabled, it will default to 3 input threads and 3 output threads.
Having more client I/O threads than members in the cluster will not lead to an increased performance. So with a 2-member cluster,
2 in and 2 out threads will give the best performance.
