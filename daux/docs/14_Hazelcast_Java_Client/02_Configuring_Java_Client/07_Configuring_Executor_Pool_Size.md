Hazelcast has an internal executor service (different from the data structure *Executor Service*) that has threads and queues to perform internal operations such as handling responses. This parameter specifies the size of the pool of threads which perform these operations laying in the executor's queue. If not configured, this parameter has the value as **5 \* *core size of the client*** (i.e. it is 20 for a machine that has 4 cores).
