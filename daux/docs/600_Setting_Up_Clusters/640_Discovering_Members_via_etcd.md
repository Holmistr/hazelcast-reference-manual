This plugin provides an [etcd](https://coreos.com/etcd/) based discovery strategy for Hazelcast enabled applications (Hazelcast 3.6 and higher). This is an easy to configure plug-and-play Hazelcast discovery strategy that will optionally register each of your Hazelcast members with etcd and enable Hazelcast members to dynamically discover one another via etcd. This discovery feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. Please see its documentation at <a href="https://github.com/bitsofinfo/hazelcast-etcd-discovery-spi/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">Hazelcast etcd Discovery</a> for information on configuring and using it.
