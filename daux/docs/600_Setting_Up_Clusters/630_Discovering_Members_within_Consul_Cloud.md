This plugin provides a Consul based discovery strategy for Hazelcast enabled applications (Hazelcast 3.6 and higher). This is an easy to configure plug-and-play Hazelcast discovery strategy that will optionally register each of your Hazelcast members with Consul and enable Hazelcast members to dynamically discover one another via Consul. This discovery feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. Please see its documentation at <a href="https://github.com/bitsofinfo/hazelcast-consul-discovery-spi" target="_blank">Hazelcast Consul</a> for information on configuring and using it.
