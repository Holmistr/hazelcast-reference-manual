Hazelcast supports EC2 auto-discovery. It is useful when you do not want to provide or you cannot provide the list of possible IP addresses. This discovery feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. Please see its own GitHub repo at <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws" target="_blank">Hazelcast AWS</a> for information on configuring and using it.

![image](../images/NoteSmall.jpg) ***NOTE:*** *hazelcast-cloud module has been renamed as hazelcast-aws module (starting with Hazelcast 3.7.3). If you want to use AWS Discovery, you should add the library hazelcast-aws JAR to your environment. For more information please look see the README of [Hazelcast AWS repo](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-aws/blob/master/README.md).*
