Use JCache providers to create caches for a specification compliant implementation. Those providers abstract the platform
specific behavior and bindings, and provide the different JCache required features.

Hazelcast has two types of providers. Depending on your application setup and the cluster topology,
you can use the Client Provider (used by Hazelcast clients) or the Server Provider (used by cluster members).
