***NOTE:*** *This feature has been deprecated. Please use the [Fast-Aggregations](../05_Fast_Aggregations) instead.*

Based on the Hazelcast MapReduce framework, Aggregators are ready-to-use data aggregations. These are typical operations like
sum up values, finding minimum or maximum values, calculating averages, and other operations that you would expect 
in the relational database world.  

Aggregation operations are implemented, as mentioned above, on top of the MapReduce framework, and all operations can be
achieved using pure MapReduce calls. However, using the Aggregation feature is more convenient for a big set of standard operations.
