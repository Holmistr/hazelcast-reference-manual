MultiMap is a specialized map where you can associate a key with multiple values. This monitoring option is similar to the **Maps** option: the same monitoring charts and data tables monitor MultiMaps. The differences are that you cannot browse the MultiMaps and re-configure it. Please see [Managing Maps](06_Managing_Maps.md).
