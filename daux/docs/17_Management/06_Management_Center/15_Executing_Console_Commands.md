The Management Center has a console feature that enables you to execute commands on the cluster. For example, you can perform `put`s and `get`s on a map, after you set the namespace with the command `ns <name of your map>`. The same is valid for queues, topics, etc. To execute your command, type it into the field below the console and press **Enter**. Type `help` to see all the commands that you can use.

Open a console window by clicking on the **Console** button located on the toolbar. Below is a sample view with some executed commands.
