Hazelcast members and native clients support jclouds&reg; for discovery. It is useful when you do not want to provide or you cannot provide the list of possible IP addresses on various cloud providers. This discovery feature is provided as a Hazelcast plugin. Please see its own GitHub repo at <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-jclouds" target="_blank">Hazelcast JClouds</a> for information on configuring and using it.
