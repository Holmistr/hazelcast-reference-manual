You can configure listeners to listen to various event types on the client side. You can configure global events not relating to any distributed object through [Client ListenerConfig](../02_Configuring_Java_Client/06_Configuring_Client_Listeners.md). You should configure distributed object listeners like map entry listeners or list item listeners through their proxies. You can refer to the related sections under each distributed data structure in this reference manual.
