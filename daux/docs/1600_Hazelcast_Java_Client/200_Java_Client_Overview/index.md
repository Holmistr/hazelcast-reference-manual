The Java client is the most full featured Hazelcast native client. It is offered both with Hazelcast IMDG and Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise.  The main idea behind the Java client is to provide the same Hazelcast functionality by proxying each operation through a Hazelcast member. It can access and change distributed data, and it can listen to distributed events of an already established Hazelcast cluster from another Java application.
