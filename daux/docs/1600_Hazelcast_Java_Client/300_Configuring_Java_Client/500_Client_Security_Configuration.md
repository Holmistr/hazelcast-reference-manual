In the cases where the security established with `GroupConfig` is not enough and you want your clients connecting securely to the cluster, you can use `ClientSecurityConfig`. This configuration has a `credentials` parameter to set the IP address and UID. Please see `ClientSecurityConfig.java` in our code.
