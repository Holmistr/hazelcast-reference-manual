Hazelcast's scheduled executor service is a data structure which implements the `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService`, partially.
Here, partially means that it allows the scheduling of a single future execution and/or at a fixed rate execution but not at a fixed delay.

On top of the Vanilla Scheduling APIs, the scheduled executor service allows additional ones such as the following:

- `scheduleOnMember`: On a specific cluster member.
- `scheduleOnKeyOwner`: On the partition owning that key.
- `scheduleOnAllMembers`: On all cluster members.
- `scheduleOnAllMembers`: On all given members.

### Scheduled Executor API

The following is the brief view of the scheduled executor API:

```
package com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor;

import com.hazelcast.core.DistributedObject;
import com.hazelcast.core.Member;
import com.hazelcast.spi.annotation.Beta;

import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

/**
 * Distributed & durable implementation similar to, but not directly inherited  ScheduledExecutorService. IScheduledExecutorService provides similar API to the ScheduledExecutorService with some
 * exceptions but also additional methods like scheduling tasks on a specific member, on a member who is owner of a specific key, executing a tasks on multiple members, etc.
 *
 *
 * Tasks (Runnable and/or Callable) scheduled on any partition through an IScheduledExecutorService,
 * yield some durability characteristics.
 *     When a member goes down (up to durability config), the scheduled task will get re-scheduled
 *     on a replica member.
 *     In the event of a partition migration, the task will be re-scheduled on the destination member.
 * 
 * Note: The above characteristics don't apply when scheduled on a Member.
 *
 * Tasks that are holding state that needs to be also durable across partitions, will need to implement the StatefulTask interface.
 *
 * Upon scheduling a task acquires a resource handler, see ScheduledTaskHandler. The handler is generated before
 * the actual scheduling of the task on the member, which allows for a way to access the future in an event of a member failure
 * immediately after scheduling, and also guarantees no duplicates in the cluster by utilizing a unique name per task.
 * A name can also be defined by the user by having the Runnable or Callable implement the NamedTask.
 * Alternatively, one can wrap any task using the TaskUtils#named(String, Callable) or
 * TaskUtils#named(String, Runnable) for simplicity.
 *
 * One difference of this service in comparison to ScheduledExecutorService is the
 * #scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit) which has similar semantic
 * to java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit). It
 * guarantees a task won't be executed by multiple threads concurrently. The difference is that this service will
 * skip a scheduled execution if another thread is still running the same task, instead of postponing its execution.
 *
 * The other difference is this service does not offer an equivalent of
 * java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService#scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable, long, long, TimeUnit)

There are two different modes of durability for the service:

1. Upon partition specific scheduling, the future task is stored both in the primary partition and also in its N backups, N being the `<durability>` property in the configuration. More specifically, there are always one or more backups to take ownership of the task in the event of a lost member. If a member is lost, the task will be re-scheduled on the backup (new primary) member, which might induce further delays on the subsequent executions of the task.
For example, if we schedule a task to run in 10 seconds from now, `schedule(new ExampleTask(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);` and after 5 seconds the owner member goes down (before the execution takes place), then the backup owner will re-schedule the task in 10 seconds from now. Therefore, from the user's perspective waiting on the result, this will be available in `10 + 5 = 15` seconds rather than 10 seconds as it is anticipated originally. If `atFixedRate` was used, then only the initial delay is affected in the above scenario, all subsequent executions should adhere to the given period parameter.    

2. Upon member specific scheduling, the future task is *only* stored in the member itself, which means that in the event of a lost member, the task will be lost as well.

To accomplish the described durability, all tasks provide a unique identity/name before the scheduling takes place. The name allows the service to reach the scheduled task even after the caller (client or member) goes down, and also allows helps to prevent duplicate tasks.
The name of the task can be user-defined if it needs to be, by implementing the `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.NamedTask` interface (plain wrapper util is available here: `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.TaskUtils#named(java.lang.String, java.lang.Runnable)`). If the task does not provide a name in its implementation, the service provides a random UUID for it, internally.

Upon scheduling, the service returns an `IScheduledFuture` which on top of the `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture` functionality provides API to get the resource handler of the task `ScheduledTaskHandler` and also the runtime statistics of the task.

Futures associated with a scheduled task act as listeners on the local member/client, in order to be aware of the lost partitions and/or members . Therefore, they are always strongly referenced on the member/client side. In order to clean up their resources, you can use `dispose()` once completed. Dispose will also cancel further executions of the task if scheduled at fixed rate.

Please see below for your reference:

```
package com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor;

import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledFuture;

/**
 * A delayed result-bearing action that can be cancelled.
 * Usually a scheduled future is the result of scheduling
 * a task with a IScheduledExecutorService.
 *
 * Enhances the default ScheduledFuture API with support
 * of statistics and time measurement info, through ScheduledTaskStatistics.
 */
public interface IScheduledFuture<V>
        extends ScheduledFuture<V> {

    /**
     * Returns the scheduled future resource handler.
     * Can be used to re-acquire control of the IScheduledFuture using the
     * IScheduledExecutorService#getScheduledFuture(ScheduledTaskHandler)
     */
    ScheduledTaskHandler getHandler();

    /**
     * Returns the statistics and time measurement info of the execution of this scheduled future
     * in the IScheduledExecutorService it was scheduled.
     */
    ScheduledTaskStatistics getStats();

    /**
     * Used to destroy the instance of the IScheduledFuture in the scheduled executor.
     * Once the instance is destroyed, any subsequent action on the {@link IScheduledFuture} will
     * fail with an IllegalStateException.
     * Attempting to re-create the IScheduledFuture from the
     * IScheduledExecutorService#getScheduledFuture(ScheduledTaskHandler) using the #getHandler()
     * will succeed, but any subsequent access on that new future, will also fail with StaleTaskException
     */
    void dispose();

    /**
     * Attempts to cancel further scheduling of this task.  This attempt will
     * fail if the task has already completed, has already been cancelled,
     * or could not be cancelled for some other reason. If successful,

     *

     *
     * After this method returns, subsequent calls to #isDone will
     * always return true.  Subsequent calls to #isCancelled
     * will always return true if this method returned true.
     */
    boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning);
}
```

The task handler, is a descriptor class holding information for the scheduled future, which is used to pinpoint the actual task in the cluster. It contains the name of the task, the owner (member or partition) and the scheduler name. 

The handler is always available after scheduling and can be stored in a plain string format `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.ScheduledTaskHandler#toUrn` and re-constructed back from that String `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.ScheduledTaskHandler#of`. If the handler is lost, you can still find a task under a given scheduler by using the Scheduler's `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.IScheduledExecutorService#getAllScheduledFutures`.

Last but not least, similar to [executor service](/00_Executor_Service), the scheduled executor service allows Stateful tasks to be scheduled. Stateful tasks, are tasks that require any kind of state during their runtime, which must also be durable along with the task in the event of a lost partition. 

Stateful tasks can be created by implementing the `com.hazelcast.scheduledexecutor.StatefulTask` interface, and providing implementation details for saving the state and loading it back. If a partition is lost, then the re-scheduled task will load the previously saved state before its execution.

### Configuring Scheduled Executor Service

This section presents example configurations for scheduled executor service along with the descriptions of its configuration elements and attributes.

**Declarative:**

```xml
<scheduled-executor-service name="myScheduledExecSvc">
	<pool-size>16</pool-size>
	<durability>1</durability>
	<capacity>100<capacity>
</scheduled-executor-service>
```

**Programmatic:**

```java
Config config = new Config();
config.getScheduledExecutorConfig( "myScheduledExecSvc" ).
      .setPoolSize ( "8" )
      .setDurability( "1" )
      .setCapacity( 100 );

HazelcastInstance hazelcast = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance(config);
ScheduledExecutorService myScheduledExecSvc = hazelcast.getScheduldExecutorService("myScheduledExecSvc");
```

Following are the descriptions of each configuration element and attribute:

* `name`: Name of the scheduled executor.
* `pool-size`: Number of executor threads per member for the executor.
* `durability`: Durability of the executor.
* `capacity`: Maximum number of tasks that a Scheduler can have per partition. Attempt to schedule more, will result in `RejectedExecutionException`. The tasks should get disposed by the user to free-up the capacity.

### Examples

Scheduling a callable that computes the cluster size in `10 seconds` from now:

```
static class DelayedClusterSizeTask implements Callable<Integer>, HazelcastInstanceAware, Serializable {

        private transient HazelcastInstance instance;

        @Override
        public Integer call()
                throws Exception {
            return instance.getCluster().getMembers().size();
        }

        @Override
        public void setHazelcastInstance(HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance) {
            this.instance = hazelcastInstance;
        }
    }

HazelcastInstance hazelcast = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
IScheduledExecutorService executorService = instance.getScheduledExecutor("myScheduler");
IScheduledFuture<Double> future = executorService.schedule(
	new DelayedClusterSizeTask(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

int membersCount = future.get(); // Block until we get the result
ScheduledTaskStatistics stats = future.getStats();
future.dispose(); // Always dispose futures that are not in use any more, to release resources

int totalTaskRuns = stats.getTotalRuns()); // = 1
```
